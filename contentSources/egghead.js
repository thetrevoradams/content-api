        "With the massive improvements to function components in React via hooks and suspense, you may be interested in seeing how to refactor a typical class component to a simpler function component that uses React Hooks features. In this course, Kent will take [a modern React codebase](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-github-profile) that uses classes and refactor the entire thing to use function components as much as possible. We’ll look at state, side effects, async code, caching, and more! Want a primer on hooks and suspense?

        "Once you’ve nailed the fundamentals of React, that’s when things get really fun. This course teaches you advanced patterns in React that you can use to make components that are simple, flexible, and enjoyable to work with. You'll start with a simple <Toggle /> component that you'll progressively refactor to each of the patterns. Throughout the course, you’ll see the benefits of each pattern and how they can be mixed-and-matched to make your components more useful (and simple for everyone who comes across them). Kent C. Dodds has built and shipped components using each of these patterns. Along the way, he will help you understand and weigh the trade-offs of each pattern so you’ll intuitively know where to apply each of them in your own components. You’ll finish the course with a list of actionable things you can do, right away, to rework the components that you're building. You’ll complete the course more knowledgeable about React components and equipped to make your components more simple.",

        "React got that name for a reason. It’s a component-based JavaScript library that renders smartly and can seriously simplify your work. This course is for React newbies and anyone looking to build a solid foundation. It’s designed to teach you everything you need to start building web applications in React right away. Each lesson in this 19-part course is a single `index.html` file. This keeps your focus on learning React, no distractions. We’ll start with a blank file and add more complexity as we go along, wrapping the course with a lesson on how to move into a more production-ready development environment—and even deploy your app to a great service like Netlify. You'll come out of this course with a solid grasp on: - what problems React can solve - how React solves those problems under the hood - what JSX is and how it translates to regular JavaScript function calls and objects You’ll build a solid understanding so when you come across JavaScript challenges down the road, you’ll know how to…react.",

It is so loaded with features that it's sometimes difficult to know what's even possible.  In this course, Kent C. Dodds takes you through some of the most valuable features of the Webpack JavaScript module bundler. We'll learn a ton about what it takes to optimize your Webpack configuration and your application to make it as fast as it can possibly be. We'll also go over what it takes to setup and write tests with webpack, Karma, Mocha, and Chai. This course covers Webpack 2, but should also be relevant for Webpack 1.x.",

        "Publishing a JavaScript library for public use requires some extra steps. You need to think about how people will use the library. From end users, to contributors your library now has a variety of people outside of yourself potentially making use of the code that you've released into the wild. From Github and npm, to releasing beta versions, semantic versioning, code coverage, continuous integration, and providing your library with a solid set of unit tests, there are a ton of things to learn. This series will guide you through a set of steps to publish a JavaScript open source library.

        "How much work would it take for you to move all of your directives and their templates to several different new directories? You'd have to update the templateUrl, script tags, etc., etc. With webpack, this can be trivial. For example, you don't need to worry about loading your templates in the $templateCache ever again. Webpack will help you modularize your css and tests. All of these things and more in this series so you can start using webpack with Angular today.",

        'Feel free to submit a PR!” - words often found in GitHub issues, but met with confusion and fear by many. Getting started with contributing open source is not always straightforward and can be tricky. With this series, you’ll be equipped with the the tools, knowledge, and understanding you need to be productive and contribute to the wonderful world of open source projects. Much of this series speaks about GitHub, but most of the concepts are generally applicable to contributing to any open source project, regardless of where it’s hosted. So enjoy the course and start contributing to the projects you use and love today!',

        'JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a more modern approach to authentication. As the web moves to a greater separation between the client and server, JWT provides a terrific alternative to traditional cookie based authentication models. For more information on JWT visit http://jwt.io/ In this series, we’ll be building a simple application to get random user information from a node server with an Angular client. We’ll then implement JWT to protect the random user resource on the server and then work through the frontend to get JWT authentication working. By the end, we’ll have an application which has a single username/password combination (for simplicity) and uses tokens to authorize the client to see the random user information. You’ll be able to login, get random users, and logout.',
